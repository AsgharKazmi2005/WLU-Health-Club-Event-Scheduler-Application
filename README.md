An application that is designed to serve as the website for the Washington & Lee University Heart Club. Includes a dynamic calendar that users can use to sign up to events. Includes a custom, abstracted admin portal for the non-technical club board to efficiently interact and update the application. Built using React and Supabase.

The Home Page: Consists of a stylish react slideshow built with the help of the react-slideshow-image library. Includes a custom-made monthly calendar that indicates the days when events are scheduled. Upon clicking                any date, the events for that date will show up and users will be able to sign up to them. Admins will have access to the user list and are able to send mass communications through the admin interface.

The Calendar Page: Includes a large weekly calendar (similar to Google Calender's UI) so that users can visualize the event timing and see more details about the event. Allows option to go into past or future weeks.
                   Uses the react-calendar library with custom themes.

The Contact Page: A short, simple, static introduction to the W&L Heart Club board coupled with a form that can be used to contact the club email. The email service used was [] and its relative simplicity made it
                  seamless to integrate

The Partners Page: It is imperative that the club is able to display their industry partners and this is done through this static page

The project has a pink-red color theme as to resonate with the Heart aspect of the club. Further more the design has been thourougly tested and is confirmed as responsive for all devices. Media queries were used to
effectively rightsize the display to each device (ie. switching to a hamburger icon). The club is continously adding new features and so I am continuing to work with them, especially making sure that non-technical
members can make changes so that I do not have to manually do so.
